# Wine-Quality-Prediction

My analysis will use Red Wine Quality Data Set...

1. Alcohol: the amount of alcohol in wine
2. Volatile acidity: are high acetic acid in wine which leads to an unpleasant vinegar taste
3. Sulphates: a wine additive that contributes to SO2 levels and acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
4. Citric Acid: acts as a preservative to increase acidity (small quantities add freshness and flavor to wines)
5. Total Sulfur Dioxide: is the amount of free + bound forms of SO2
6. Density: sweeter wines have a higher density
7. Chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine
8. Fixed acidity: are non-volatile acids that do not evaporate readily
9. pH: the level of acidity
10. Free Sulfur Dioxide: it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
11. Residual sugar: is the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops. The key is to have a perfect balance between â€” sweetness and sourness (wines > 45g/ltrs are sweet)
